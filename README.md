# Bluesky Link Preview

Generate permalinks to Bluesky posts that you can embed in a website.

Posts are not cached. This means that if a post becomes unavailable or private, the link will no longer work.

Text posts, posts with embedded posts, and posts that contain one or more images are supported by this project.

_This project is not affiliated with [Bluesky](https://bsky.app)._

## How to Embed

To create an embedded link, go to [https://bsky.link](https://bsky.link) and enter the URL of the Bluesky post you want to embed. The application will generate an iframe that you can embed in your site.

You can also reference a link directly in your own `iframe` using this syntax:

```
<iframe src="https://bsky.link/?url=<post_url>"></iframe>
```

## Application Routes

Finally, run the following command to start the application server:
